If the function is calling itself more than one time, then it is a tree recursion 

void fun (int n ) {
  if (n > 0) {
    printf("\n%d", n);
    fun(n-1);
    fun(n-1);
  }
}
fun(3);

For following example, time complexity is :
Total number of function calls are O(2^n)
= 2^n+1 - 1 Geometric progression 
Space complexity depends on height of the tree : number of activation records 
for n = 3, 4 was the height 

Space complexity : O(n)
