Tail recursion:
Call to the function is the last statement in the function.
Hence, all the operations are bring done at the calling time.
Nothing is being done at the returning time.

If something has to be performed at returning time, then it can not be a tail recursion 
Example:
void  func(int n)
{
  if (n > 0) {
    printf("\n%d", n);
    func(n-1);
  }
}

func(3);
