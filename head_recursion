Head recursion:
There is not statement before the function call 
It has to do everything at returning time.
void func(int n ) {
  if (n > 0) {
    func(n-1);
    printf("\n%d", n);
  }
}

func(3);
O/P: 1, 2, 3

Head recursions can not be converted into the loop as it is. it can be converted with some additional code, bt not as it is!
